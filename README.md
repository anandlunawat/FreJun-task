# Frejun Task - User Search Application
This project is a React application that includes a login page and a user page. The user page includes a search box and a table that displays data returned by an API. The application was built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI.

## Getting Started
To run the application, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. Once you have installed these, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install the project dependencies.
Run npm start to start the development server.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
## Features
## Login Page
The login page allows users to enter their email and password to log in to the application. If the user enters valid credentials, they will be redirected to the user page. If they enter invalid credentials, an error message will be displayed.

## User Page
The user page includes a search box where the user can enter a search term to initiate the search. The data is then displayed in a table on the page.
